# GDP and Life Expectancy Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between GDP and life expectancy at birth across several countries and years. The goal is to uncover trends, correlations, and insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.

## Features

- Visualization of Life Expectancy and GDP over time for all countries.
- Scatterplots visualizing GDP vs Life Expectancy per country.
- Statistical correlation analysis (Pearson correlation) overall and by country.
- Distribution plots (boxplots) for GDP and Life Expectancy across countries.
- Correlation heatmap of numeric features.
- Clear conclusions and interpretation of results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.13.5 installed along with the following packages:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them via pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

### Running the code

- Run the Jupyter notebook `life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb` for an interactive exploration.
- Alternatively, run the Python script:
python life_expectancy_gdp.py

## Results and Conclusion

The analysis shows strong positive correlations between GDP and life expectancy within individual countries, reaffirming the impact of economic growth on health. However, the overall correlation across all countries is lower due to the diverse economic and health profiles worldwide.
